                    weaker in the Second World War.He thought of striking it from all sides.
                    One day he escaped from Calcutta in the guise of a Pathan and went to Germany via <br>
                        Peshawar . From Germany he went to Japan . He organized the Indain National Army <br>
                            that fought many battles against the British forces .He said to his countrymen -<br>
                                ,"Give me blood and I will give you freedom."
